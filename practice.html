        interstellar gas, dust,
         and dark matter bound together by gravity.[1][2] The word is derived from
          the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky
           Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 
           billion stars,[3] range in size from dwarfs with less than a hundred million stars,
            to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars, each
             orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in
              the form of dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form
               of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies
